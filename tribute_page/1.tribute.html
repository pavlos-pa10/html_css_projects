          Festival Award for her performance in the 1960 film Never on Sunday.
          Mercouri was also nominated for three Golden Globes and two BAFTA
          Awards in her acting career.
        </p>
        <p>

          Parliament. In October 1981, Mercouri became the first female Minister
          of Culture and Sports.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mercouri became well-known to international audiences when she starred
          in Never on Sunday (1960), of which Dassin was the director and
          co-star. For this film, she earned the Best Actress Award at the 1960
          Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best
          Actress and the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.

          After her first major international success, Mercouri went on to star
          in Phaedra (1962), for which she was nominated again for the BAFTA
          Award and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Motion Picture
          Drama. The recognition of her acting talent did not stop though, as
          her role in Topkapi (1964) granted her one more nomination, this time
          for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Motion Picture Musical
          or Comedy. Mercouri worked with such directors as Joseph Losey,
          Vittorio De Sica, Ronald Neame, Carl Foreman, Norman Jewison, and

          Mercouri continued her stage career in the Greek production of

          was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading
          Actress in a Musical. Mercouri's performance in Promise at Dawn (1970)
          earned her another Golden Globe Award nomination.

        <h2>Melina in politics</h2>
        <h3>Activism against the Greek junta</h3>
        <p>
          At the time of the coup d'Ã©tat in Greece by a group of colonels of the
          Greek military on 21 April 1967, she was in the United States, playing
          in Illya Darling. She immediately joined the struggle against the
          Greek Military Junta and started an international campaign, travelling
          all over the world to inform the public and contribute to the
          isolation and fall of the colonels. As a result, the dictatorial
          regime revoked her Greek citizenship and confiscated her property.
        </p>

        <p>
          When her citizenship was taken away, she said: "I was born a Greek and
          I will die a Greek. Those bastards were born fascists and they will
          die fascists".
        </p>
        <p>
          While in London she worked with Amalia Fleming and Helen Vlachos of
          Kathimerini against the junta of the colonels.
        </p>

        <h3>Greek Minister of culture</h3>
        She was minister for Culture in Greece between 1981-1989 and 1993-1994.
        She advocated the return of the Parthenon marbles to Athens from the
        British museum.
